This was the third coursework ("Innovation in Games", use a new technology in a game) in the Game Design course that I took at university, and it's completely made by me. It's a VR game, and it's about time stopping like in "The Matrix" - you can slow down time and grab or dodge bullets, so you feel like Neo. The game itself has a James Bond theme (hence the name) and is inspired by games like "I Expect You To Die" and "The Stanley Parable". I even managed to get a voice actor to play the typical voice in the agent's ear, who introduces the mechanics and gives a short introduction.

For a downloadable exe of the game, you can click (here)[https://ioiototm.itch.io/008-vr-extravaganza]. It's a very old version of Unity and SteamVR, so it might not work on newer systems.
For a playthrough of the game, you can click (here)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKTwLkeMIdQ&list=PLITcD5eG9Xv0I6lWPmTrwjuq59tZjw3zf&index=7], which shows the game being played by the markers of the course.
