This was the third coursework ("Innovation in Games", use a new technology in a game) in the Game Design course that I took at university, and it's completely made by me. It's a VR game, and it's about time stopping like in "The Matrix" - you can slow down time and grab or dodge bullets, so you feel like Neo. The game itself has a James Bond theme (hence the name "008: VR Extravaganza") and is inspired by games like "I Expect You To Die" and "The Stanley Parable". I even managed to get a voice actor to play the typical voice in the agent's ear, who introduces the mechanics and gives a short introduction.

The code itself is very old and uses very old and outdated libraries, so it won't work on newer versions of Unity without refactoring. Still, I am putting it on GitHub for posterity.


For a downloadable exe of the game, you can click [here](https://ioiototm.itch.io/008-vr-extravaganza). It's a very old version of Unity and SteamVR, so it might not work on newer systems.
For a playthrough of the game, you can click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKTwLkeMIdQ&list=PLITcD5eG9Xv0I6lWPmTrwjuq59tZjw3zf&index=7), which shows the game being played by the markers of the course.
